**Bay Area Hiking Trail Recommender** <br> <br> [Application](https://share.streamlit.io/1arjunarora/hikingapp/main/Hiking_app.py)

Use this app to **make hiking trail recommendations from some sample scenic images and hike descriptions** (and help your friends and family select an appropriate hike this weekend!). Users do not have to convert text, images or field selections into a standardized format before making predictions. The deployment and app takes care of all the data processing, feature engineering, data standardization and integration, and model scoring tasks required to generate a nice output. Enjoy!!

**Datarobot Visual AI allows you to include images as input features in your ML modeling datasets** (You can use the image data alongside other data types to improve outcomes and results for various types of modeling workflows â€” regression, classification, anomaly detection, clustering, and more). 

**The following  use cases illustrate the importance of visual learning in different industry scenarios:**

- **Manufacturing**: Automate the quality control process by enabling models to identify defects
- **Healthcare**: Automated disease detection and diagnosis
- **Energy**: Analyze images from drones to make energy assets safer or more efficient
- **Public safety**: Detect intruders from security cameras
- **Insurance**: Risk analysis and claims assessment
