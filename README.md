**Bay Area Hiking Trail Predictions** <br> <br> [Application](https://share.streamlit.io/1arjunarora/hikingapp/main/Hiking_app.py)

Make hiking trail predictions from sample scenic images and text descriptions (and help your friends and family select an appropriate hike this weekend!). Users do not have to convert text, images or field selections into a standardized format before making predictions. The deployment and app take care of all the data processing, feature engineering, and model scoring tasks required to generate the output. Enjoy!!

Datarobot Visual AI allows you to include images as features in your datasets (You can use the image data alongside other data types to improve outcomes for various types of modeling workflows â€”regression, classification, anomaly detection, clustering, and more.)
